### Problem 1(answer posted)

\##my answer:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from? There are 134 aisles. fresh fruits and fresh vegetables are the
most items ordered from.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle)%>%
  summarise(n_each_aisle = n()) %>%
  filter(n_each_aisle >= 10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_each_aisle)) %>%
  mutate(ordernumber_level = if_else(n_each_aisle <= 20000, "<=20k",
                                     if_else(n_each_aisle <= 30000 & n_each_aisle > 20000, "20k-30k",
                                             if_else(n_each_aisle <= 40000 & n_each_aisle > 30000, "30k-40k",
                                                     if_else(n_each_aisle <= 50000 & n_each_aisle > 40000, "40k-50k",
                                                             if_else(n_each_aisle > 50000, ">50k", NA_character_))))))%>%
  mutate(ordernumber_level = factor(ordernumber_level, levels = c(">50k", "40k-50k", "30k-40k", "20k-30k","<=20k")))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_each_aisle)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(vars(ordernumber_level), ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "number of orders on each item", y = "number of orders") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face="bold", color="#993333", size=6, angle=45))

#### Read in the data

``` r
instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_qx2222_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names;

include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data with reasonable
variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables
exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel_data = read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = "activity_1":"activity_1440", names_to = "time", values_to = "activities" )%>%
  separate(time, c("repeatedword","minute"), sep = "_") %>%
  select(-repeatedword) %>%
  arrange(minute) %>%
  mutate(minute = as.integer(minute)) %>%
  mutate(weekday_or_weekend = if_else(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday" )) %>%
  mutate(weekday_or_weekend = factor(weekday_or_weekend))
```

Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals.
Are any trends apparent?

``` r
totals_table = 
  accel_data %>% group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(activities))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
totals_table
```

    ## # A tibble: 35 × 3
    ## # Groups:   week [5]
    ##     week day         total
    ##    <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>
    ##  1     1 Friday    480543.
